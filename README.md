Welcome to my R GitHub repository! This collection contains a plethora of projects and scripts that have been instrumental in simplifying and enhancing my experience while studying and practicing R programming. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced R user, these resources are designed to make your journey smoother and more enjoyable.

Inside this repository, you'll find a diverse range of projects that cover various aspects of R programming. Each project is carefully crafted to target specific concepts and techniques, making it easy for you to grasp and apply them effectively. The projects are structured in a way that promotes progressive learning, allowing you to build upon your existing knowledge and skills.

Not only will you find complete projects, but I have also included individual scripts that focus on tackling specific challenges or implementing useful functionalities. These scripts can serve as valuable building blocks for your own R projects, saving you time and effort in the development process.
