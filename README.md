## Projects Organized by Topics

### 1. **Basic R Concepts**
- **Introduction to R Programming**: Covers fundamental R concepts including data types, variables, operators, and control structures like loops and conditionals.
- **Data Structures in R**: Explains basic data structures in R such as vectors, matrices, lists, and data frames, including how to manipulate and work with them.
- **Functions and Packages**: Learn how to write your own functions and use libraries like `dplyr`, `tidyr`, and `ggplot2` to enhance functionality.

### 2. **Data Manipulation and Cleaning**
- **Data Cleaning with `dplyr` and `tidyr`**: How to handle missing data, remove duplicates, and reshape data into tidy formats.
- **String Manipulation**: Working with text data using functions like `stringr` for extracting and cleaning string variables.
- **Merging and Combining Data**: Best practices for merging datasets, using joins, and handling relational data.
- **Handling Time Data**: Working with dates and times in R, including parsing, formatting, and performing time-based operations.

### 3. **Data Visualization**
- **Visualizing Data with `ggplot2`**: Creating high-quality, customizable static plots like bar charts, histograms, scatter plots, and boxplots.
- **Advanced Visualization Techniques**: Using faceting, themes, and other `ggplot2` customization options to make your visualizations stand out.
- **Interactive Data Visualizations**: How to use `plotly` and `shiny` to create dynamic, interactive plots and dashboards.

### 4. **Statistical Analysis**
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Calculating measures such as mean, median, standard deviation, and visualizing distributions.
- **Hypothesis Testing**: Applying statistical tests like t-tests, ANOVA, and chi-square to draw inferences from your data.
- **Correlation and Regression**: Learn about correlation coefficients and build simple linear regression models for prediction and analysis.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assessing model performance with metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC curves.

### 5. **Time Series Analysis**
- **Time Series Decomposition**: Breaking down time series data into trend, seasonality, and residual components to better understand the data.
- **Forecasting Techniques**: Using `forecast` and `prophet` libraries to predict future values and trends.
- **ARIMA Modeling**: Building and tuning AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models for time series forecasting.

### 6. **Machine Learning and Predictive Analytics**
- **Supervised Learning**: Implementing regression and classification algorithms (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and k-NN) in R.
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Techniques such as clustering and dimensionality reduction (e.g., k-means, PCA).
- **Model Optimization**: Tuning models using cross-validation and hyperparameter optimization methods to improve performance.
- **Ensemble Methods**: Combining multiple models to boost predictive power, including Random Forests and Gradient Boosting Machines.

## Utility Scripts
Along with the full projects, I've included smaller, utility-focused scripts that handle specific tasks. These scripts are designed to save you time and effort in your own projects.

- **Data Cleaning Scripts**: Scripts that help you clean datasets by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and transforming data into useful formats.
- **Model Performance Evaluation**: Scripts for evaluating model results, including calculating performance metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.
- **Plot Customization**: Custom functions to tweak and enhance visualizations, making it easier to generate publication-ready plots.

These utility scripts are meant to be reusable, making it easier for you to incorporate them into your own projects.
