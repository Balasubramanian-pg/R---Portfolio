## Projects Organized by Topics

### 1. **Basic R Concepts and Foundations**
The foundation of any R programming journey is understanding the core concepts that drive the language. This section covers the very basics of R, such as how to handle data, the basic structure of R code, and simple manipulations that will form the base of your learning. This is perfect for anyone new to R.

- **Introduction to R Programming**: This project focuses on getting you comfortable with the R environment, covering the syntax, basic operations, and control structures in R such as loops (`for`, `while`) and conditionals (`if`, `else`). You’ll learn how to write basic R code and structure it for clarity and efficiency.
- **Data Structures in R**: Data is central to any programming language, and R offers a rich set of data structures. This section delves into the different types of data structures available in R, including vectors, matrices, lists, data frames, and factors. You'll learn when to use each structure and how to manipulate and subset your data effectively.
- **Functions and Packages**: One of the best features of R is the ability to write reusable functions and extend functionality with packages. In this project, you’ll learn how to write your own custom functions and work with R’s vast ecosystem of libraries, such as `dplyr`, `ggplot2`, and `tidyr`.

### 2. **Data Manipulation and Cleaning**
Data cleaning is often the most time-consuming part of any analysis. This section focuses on techniques and best practices for manipulating and cleaning your data to ensure it’s ready for analysis. The goal is to help you work with real-world messy datasets by applying techniques for transforming, reshaping, and cleaning data.

- **Data Cleaning with `dplyr` and `tidyr`**: These two packages are staples in R for manipulating and cleaning data. Here, you’ll learn to filter, sort, aggregate, and summarize data using `dplyr`. You’ll also learn how to reshape data using `tidyr` to make it tidy and ready for further analysis. Topics include handling missing values, removing duplicates, and normalizing data formats.
- **String Manipulation**: Working with string data in R can be tricky. This script will show you how to use the `stringr` package to manipulate and extract information from text fields. You’ll learn how to clean text data by removing unwanted characters, splitting strings, and performing pattern matching.
- **Merging and Combining Data**: Often in data analysis, you will need to combine multiple datasets. This project focuses on joining datasets using functions like `merge()` and `left_join()`. You’ll also learn how to handle common merging issues, like handling missing data in the joined tables and ensuring the merge is done properly.
- **Handling Date and Time Data**: Dates and times are frequently encountered in real-world datasets, but they can be difficult to work with. This section covers how to parse dates, calculate time differences, and handle timezone-related issues using the `lubridate` package.

### 3. **Data Visualization**
Visualizing your data is key to understanding and communicating your findings. In this section, you’ll learn the best practices for creating clear, effective, and aesthetically pleasing visualizations using `ggplot2` and other visualization tools in R.

- **Creating Static Visualizations with `ggplot2`**: `ggplot2` is a powerful library for creating static plots in R. This project will guide you through the creation of a variety of common plots, including histograms, bar charts, scatter plots, and box plots. You’ll also learn how to customize these plots by adding titles, labels, and adjusting colors.
- **Advanced Plotting with `ggplot2`**: This section goes deeper into `ggplot2`, exploring more advanced techniques like faceting (creating multiple plots based on categories), using themes to adjust the look of plots, and adding custom annotations. You'll also learn how to use color palettes to make your plots visually appealing.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: While static plots are great, sometimes you need more interactivity. In this section, you’ll explore how to create dynamic plots using `plotly` and `shiny`, allowing users to interact with the data and visualize trends in real time.

### 4. **Statistical Analysis**
Statistical analysis is the backbone of data science and is essential for making informed decisions based on your data. This section will guide you through common statistical methods and how to implement them in R.

- **Descriptive Statistics**: Learn how to summarize your data using descriptive statistics like mean, median, variance, and standard deviation. You’ll also explore how to visualize distributions and assess the shape of your data.
- **Hypothesis Testing**: This section covers hypothesis testing in R, including common tests like the t-test, chi-square test, and ANOVA. You’ll learn how to interpret p-values, confidence intervals, and test results to make decisions about your data.
- **Regression Analysis**: In this section, you’ll learn how to build regression models, including simple linear regression, multiple linear regression, and logistic regression. You’ll also learn about model diagnostics, including residuals and the R-squared value.
- **Correlation and Causation**: You’ll learn how to assess relationships between variables using correlation techniques, and how to distinguish between correlation and causation.

### 5. **Time Series Analysis**
Time series data is crucial in many fields such as finance, economics, and operations. In this section, you’ll explore how to work with time series data, perform time series decomposition, and forecast future values.

- **Time Series Decomposition**: Learn how to break down a time series into its components, such as trend, seasonality, and residuals. This is an important first step before making any predictions.
- **Forecasting with `forecast` and `prophet`**: You’ll learn how to apply popular forecasting methods like ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) and Prophet, which is particularly useful for handling large-scale time series with daily observations.
- **ARIMA Modeling**: Dive deeper into time series forecasting with ARIMA models, which are widely used for making predictions based on past observations. This section explains how to choose the best ARIMA model and how to perform model diagnostics.

### 6. **Machine Learning and Predictive Analytics**
Machine learning is an exciting and rapidly growing area in data science. In this section, you’ll learn how to build and evaluate predictive models, including supervised and unsupervised learning techniques.

- **Supervised Learning**: You’ll learn how to apply algorithms like decision trees, k-nearest neighbors (k-NN), and random forests for both regression and classification tasks. You'll explore how to train a model, make predictions, and evaluate performance.
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Learn how to apply unsupervised learning techniques like k-means clustering and principal component analysis (PCA) to find patterns in data without labeled outcomes.
- **Model Tuning and Evaluation**: This section covers techniques for improving the performance of your models through hyperparameter tuning, cross-validation, and metrics evaluation (e.g., precision, recall, F1 score).
- **Ensemble Methods**: Explore how combining multiple models can lead to better predictive performance using ensemble methods like bagging and boosting (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost).
